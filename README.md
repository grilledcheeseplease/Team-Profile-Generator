# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

Here is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The displayed emails are clickable and will populate the default email application when clicked. The same concept applies to the GitHub profile usernames. 

When you start the application with the command line 'node index.js', you will be prompted for the manager's information and then asked if you would like to add another team member. The rest of the program will depend on user input, as differing questions will populate depending on the role type chosen. Once you are done adding team members a styled HTML file will populate in the output folder to display all the team members and their information.
